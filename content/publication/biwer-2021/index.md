abstract: "During the COVID-19 pandemic, universities had to shift from face-to-face
  to emergency remote education. Students were forced to study online, with limited
  access to facilities and less contact with peers and teachers, while at the same
  time being exposed to more autonomy. This study examined how students adapted to
  emergency remote learning, specifically focusing on students' resource management
  strategies using an individual differences approach. One thousand and eight hundred
  university students completed a questionnaire on their resource management strategies
  and indicators of (un)successful adaptation to emergency remote learning. On average,
  students reported being less able to regulate their attention, effort, and time,
  and less motivated compared to the situation before the crisis started; they also
  reported investing more time and effort in their self-study. Using a k-means cluster
  analysis, we identified four adaptation profiles and labeled them according to the
  reported changes in their resource management strategies: the overwhelmed, the surrenderers,
  the maintainers, and the adapters. Both the overwhelmed and surrenderers appeared
  to be less able to regulate their effort, attention and time, and reported to be
  less motivated to study than before the crisis. In contrast, the adapters appreciated
  the increased level of autonomy and were better able to self-regulate their learning.
  The resource management strategies of the maintainers remained relatively stable.
  Students' responses to open-answer questions on their educational experience, coded
  using a thematic analysis, were consistent with the quantitative profiles. Implications
  about how to support students in adapting to online learning are discussed."
