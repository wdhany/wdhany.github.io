abstract: A recent meta-analysis has shown that media multitasking behavior, or consuming
  multiple streams of media simultaneously, might not be associated with less efficient
  cognitive processing, as measured with objective tests. Nevertheless, a growing
  number of studies have reported that media multitasking is correlated with cognitive
  functioning in everyday situations, as measured in self-reports. Here, in a series
  of mini meta-analyses, we show that the self-reported correlates of media multitasking
  can be categorized in at least four major themes. Heavy media multitasking was associated
  with increasing problems with attention regulation (e.g., increased mind-wandering
  and distractibility), behavior regulation (e.g., emotion regulation and self-monitor),
  inhibition/impulsiveness (e.g., higher level of impulsiveness and lower level of
  inhibition), and memory. However, the pooled effect sizes were small (z =.16 to
  z =.22), indicating that a large proportion of variance of media multitasking behavior
  is still unaccounted for. Additionally, we witnessed a high level of heterogeneity
  in the attention regulation theme, which might indicate the presence of the risk
  of study bias.
