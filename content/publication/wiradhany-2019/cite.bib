 abstract = {Many researchers have used the Media Multitasking Index (MMI) for investigating media multitasking behaviour. While useful as a means to compare inter-individual multitasking levels, the MMI disregards the variability in media multitasking choice behaviour: certain media combinations are more likely to be selected than others, and these patterns might differ from one population to another. The aim of the present study was to examine media multitasking choices in different populations. For this means, we employed a social network approach to render MMI responses collected in eight different populations into networks. The networks showed that the level of media multitasking as measured by the network densities differed across populations, yet, the pattern of media multitasking behaviour was similar. Specifically, media combinations which involved texting/IMing, listening to music, browsing, and social media were prominent in most datasets. Overall the findings indicate that media multitasking behaviours might be confined within a smaller set of media activities. Accordingly, instead of assessing a large number of media combinations, future studies might consider focusing on a more limited set of media types.},
