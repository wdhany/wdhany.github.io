abstract: 'Many researchers have used the Media Multitasking Index (MMI) for investigating
  media multitasking behaviour. While useful as a means to compare inter-individual
  multitasking levels, the MMI disregards the variability in media multitasking choice
  behaviour: certain media combinations are more likely to be selected than others,
  and these patterns might differ from one population to another. The aim of the present
  study was to examine media multitasking choices in different populations. For this
  means, we employed a social network approach to render MMI responses collected in
  eight different populations into networks. The networks showed that the level of
  media multitasking as measured by the network densities differed across populations,
  yet, the pattern of media multitasking behaviour was similar. Specifically, media
  combinations which involved texting/IMing, listening to music, browsing, and social
  media were prominent in most datasets. Overall the findings indicate that media
  multitasking behaviours might be confined within a smaller set of media activities.
  Accordingly, instead of assessing a large number of media combinations, future studies
  might consider focusing on a more limited set of media types.'
