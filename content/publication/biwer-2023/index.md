abstract: "Background: During self-study, students need to monitor and regulate mental
  effort to replete working memory resources and optimize learning results. Taking
  breaks during self-study could be an effective effort regulation strategy. However,
  little is known about how breaktaking relates to self-regulated learning. Aims:
  We investigated the effects of taking systematic or self-regulated breaks on mental
  effort, task experiences and task completion in real-life study sessions for 1 day.
  Sample: Eighty-seven bachelor's and master's students from a Dutch University. Methods:
  Students participated in an online intervention during their self-study. In the
  self-regulated-break condition (n = 35), students self-decided when to take a break;
  in the systematic break conditions, students took either a 6-min break after every
  24-min study block (systematic-long or ‘Pomodoro technique', n = 25) or a 3-min
  break after every 12-min study block (systematic-short, n = 27). Results: Students
  had longer study sessions and breaks when self-regulating. This was associated with
  higher levels of fatigue and distractedness, and lower levels of concentration and
  motivation compared to those in the systematic conditions. We found no difference
  between groups in invested mental effort or task completion. Conclusions: Taking
  pre-determined, systematic breaks during a study session had mood benefits and appeared
  to have efficiency benefits (i.e., similar task completion in shorter time) over
  taking self-regulated breaks. Measuring how mental effort dynamically fluctuates
  over time and how effort spent on the learning task differs from effort spent on
  regulating break-taking requires further research."
