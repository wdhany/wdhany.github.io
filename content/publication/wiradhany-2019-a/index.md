abstract: Previous studies suggest that frequent media multitasking – the simultaneous
  use of different media at the same time – may be associated with increased susceptibility
  to internal and external sources of distraction. At the same time, other studies
  found no evidence for such associations. In the current study, we report the results
  of a large-scale study (N=261) in which we measured media multitasking with a short
  media-use questionnaire and measured distraction with a change-detection task that
  included different numbers of distractors. To determine whether internally generated
  distraction affected performance, we deployed experience-sampling probes during
  the change-detection task. The results showed that participants with higher media
  multitasking scores did not perform worse as distractor set size increased, they
  did not perform worse in general, and their responses on the experience-sampling
  probes made clear that they also did not experience more lapses of attention during
  the task. Critically, these results were robust across different methods of analysis
  (i.e., Linear Mixed Modeling, Bayes factors, and extreme-groups comparison). At
  the same time, our use of the short version of the media-use questionnaire might
  limit the generalizability of our findings. In light of our results, we suggest
  that future studies should ensure an adequate level of statistical power and implement
  a more precise measure for media multitasking.
