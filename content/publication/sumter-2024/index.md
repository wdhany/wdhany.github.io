abstract: Health professionals and scholars alike consider evening smartphone use
  an important public health challenge. Existing research on the effects of smartphone
  usage on sleep has three limitations, namely reliance on self-report measures of
  smartphone use and/or sleep, limited attention to within-person effects, and a focus
  on general screentime rather than specific app usage. The current study addressed
  these limitations by conducting a seven-day study assessing smartphone use and sleep
  with a combination of subjective and objective measures among 75 students. The findings
  do not support the assumption that evening smartphone interferes with sleep. We
  did observe between-person relationships between specific indicators of smartphone
  usage and sleep, e.g. sleep quality was positively related to the use of meditation
  apps, and negatively related to the use of work-related apps. These findings indicate
  research should focus on what individuals do on their phones instead of how much
  time they spend.
